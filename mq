Why did you miss Sparrow, Starling, Kestrel, Amazon SQS, Beanstalkd, Kafka, IronMQ ?

Message Queue Servers

Message queue servers are available in various languages, Erlang (RabbitMQ), C (beanstalkd), Ruby (Starling or Sparrow), Scala (Kestrel, Kafka) or Java (ActiveMQ). A short overview can be found here

Sparrow

written by Alex MacCaw
Sparrow is a lightweight queue written in Ruby that “speaks memcache”
Starling

written by Blaine Cook at Twitter
Starling is a Message Queue Server based on MemCached
written in Ruby
stores jobs in memory (message queue)
documentation: some good tutorials, for example the railscast about starling and workling or this blog post about starling
Kestrel

written by Robey Pointer
Starling clone written in Scala (a port of Starling from Ruby to Scala)
Queues are stored in memory, but logged on disk
RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is a Message Queue Server in Erlang
stores jobs in memory (message queue)
Apache ActiveMQ

ActiveMQ is an open source message broker in Java
Beanstalkd

written by Philotic, Inc. to improve the response time of a Facebook application
in-memory workqueue service mostly written in C
Docu: http://nubyonrails.com/articles/about-this-blog-beanstalk-messaging-queue
Amazon SQS

Amazon Simple Queue Service
Kafka

Written at LinkedIn in Scala
Used by LinkedIn to offload processing of all page and other views
Defaults to using persistence, uses OS disk cache for hot data (has higher throughput then any of the above having persistence enabled)
Supports both on-line as off-line processing
ZMQ

The socket library that acts as a concurrency framework
Faster than TCP, for clustered products and supercomputing
Carries messages across inproc, IPC, TCP, and multicast
Connect N-to-N via fanout, pubsub, pipeline, request-reply
Asynch I/O for scalable multicore message-passing apps
EagleMQ

EagleMQ is an open source, high-performance and lightweight queue manager.
Written in C
Stores all data in memory and support persistence.
It has its own protocol. Supports work with queues, routes and channels.
IronMQ

IronMQ
Written in Go
Fully managed queue service
Available both as cloud version and on-premise
I hope that this will be helpful for us. source
