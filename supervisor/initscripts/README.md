# Init Scripts

This repository contains user-contributed scripts for running 
[Supervisor](https://github.com/supervisor/supervisor) under
various operating systems.  If a script is not available for
your favorite system, consider writing one.

## Contributing

Fork the repository, add your well-tested script, then send a 
pull request.  Please include your contact information in the
script and clearly indicate what system(s) your script supports. 

## Maintainers

The Supervisor maintainers will occasionally merge pull requests but
in general do not have enough bandwidth to test or maintain the scripts 
in this repository.  

If you are modifying an existing script, please make an attempt to
discuss your change with the script's original author before opening
a pull request.
